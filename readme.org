  This repository is in support of a course to teach psychology
  students basic tools for using their computers to support academic
  and professional use.

  The ~course.org~ file is my outline for what I plan to teach and the order I plan to go about it. If you are not in the course and stumble across this site, I would love to hear any feedback you have about the structure, missing components, or suggestions for inclusion. Many of the other files are there to support the above, and also to give students practice using version control. 

  Basically, if you are not a student in the course, or maybe someone teaching computer skills to those without a CS background, this repo won't be of use to you.
